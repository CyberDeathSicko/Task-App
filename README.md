Example of Your To-Do List App
Let's use your To-Do List App as an example. Here's how it works:

Open the To-Do List App in a web browser.

You'll see a "To-Do List" with an input box and an "Add" button.

Type a task in the input box and click the "Add" button.

The task will be added to the list below with a close (X) button.

You can click on a task to mark it as completed (line-through text).

You can also click the close (X) button to delete a task.

Your tasks are automatically saved in the browser's localStorage, so you won't lose them when you refresh the page or close the browser.

That's how your To-Do List App works!
